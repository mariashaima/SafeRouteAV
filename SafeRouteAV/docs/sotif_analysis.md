# SOTIF Analysis (ISO 21448)

## Performance Limitations

- Map discretization errors.
- Perception noise.
- Dynamic obstacle unpredictability.

## Trigger Scenarios

- Narrow lanes.
- Cut-in vehicles.
- Sudden braking lead vehicle.

## Mitigation

- RL-based fine tuning.
- Conservative TTC threshold.
- Risk-inflated planning cost.
